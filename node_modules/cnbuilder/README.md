One more DOM classname string builder if you not enough yet 😁  
It is **[lightweight](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=cnbuilder)**, **[fast](#performance-recent-benchmarks-results)** and has no dependencies!  
Designed to be fastest full-feature drop-in replacement for `classnames` package.

Install it via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

```bash
npm i cnbuilder
# OR
yarn add cnbuilder
```

Use it wherever and however you want - node.js or webpack, CJS or ESM modules!

**INSTALLATION NOTE:**  
This lib is written in ES6+ and delivering with both, transpiled and untranspiled versions:

- `main` field of `package.json` is pointing to transpiled ES3-compatible version with CJS modules resolution;
- `module` field is pointing to transpiled ES3-compatible version with ES modules resolution;
- `esnext` field is pointing to the ES6+ version with ES modules resolution;

Depending on your targets you may have to use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and/or
[Babel](http://babeljs.io/) to pull untranspiled version of package.  
See some tips on wiring thing up: [https://2ality.com/2017/06/pkg-esnext.html](https://2ality.com/2017/06/pkg-esnext.html)

Use it wherever and however you want - node.js or webpack, CJS or ESM modules!

```javascript
var cnb = require("cnbuilder");

cnb("cnbuilder", { is: true }, ["awesome!"]); // => 'cnbuilder is awesome!'
```

```typescript
import cnb from "cnbuilder";

cnb("works", { with: true }, ["ESM!"]); // => 'works with ESM!'
```

### Why

`cnbuilder` is designed to be as lightweight and fast as possible, without loosing the functionality ([jorgebucaran/classcat](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/classcat) is faster in some cases but less handy because does not allow to pass variable count of arguments).
It is written with power of [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and it's API is fully compatible with [JedWatson/classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames), so it wont be anyhow hard to migrate if you're already using `classnames` package.

### Usage

As already said - API is the same with `classnames` pkg, and due to my laziness - i'll just copy-past their usage documentation (with small additions)😅😱

The `cnb` function takes any number of arguments which can be a string, array or object. Any other input will be ignored.
The argument `'foo'` is short for `{ foo: true }` or `['foo']`. If the value associated with a given key is falsy, that key won't be included in the output.

```js
cnb("foo", "bar"); // => 'foo bar'
cnb("foo", { bar: true }); // => 'foo bar'
cnb({ "foo-bar": true }); // => 'foo-bar'
cnb({ "foo-bar": false }); // => ''
cnb({ foo: true }, { bar: true }); // => 'foo bar'
cnb({ foo: true, bar: true }); // => 'foo bar'

// lots of arguments of various types
cnb("foo", { bar: true, duck: false }, "baz", { quux: true }); // => 'foo bar baz quux'

// other falsy values are just ignored
cnb(null, false, "bar", undefined, 0, 1, { baz: null }, ""); // => 'bar 1'
```

Arrays will be recursively flattened as per the rules above:

```js
var arr = ["b", { c: true, d: false }];
cnb("a", arr); // => 'a b c'
```

**BUT!** there are two additions, comparing to `classnames` result generation:

- it does not generate useless spaces:
  ```javascript
  classnames("test", [], { a: false }); // => "test " (5 chars with space at the end)
  cnb("test", [], { a: false }); // => "test" (just 4 chars)
  ```
- it skips fully numeric classnames, due to classnames starting with digit are illegal, but it **can't** skip strings starting with digit, cause it would impact the performance, so that part is left for the end developer
  ```javascript
  classnames(321, "1stPlace"); // => "321 1stPlace"
  cnb(321, "1stPlace"); // => "1stPlace"
  ```

#### Dynamic class names with ES2015

If you're in an environment that supports [computed keys](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-object-initializer) (available in ES2015 and Babel) you can use dynamic class names:

```javascript
let buttonType = "primary";
cnb({ [`btn-${buttonType}`]: true });
```

### Polyfills needed to support older browsers

`Array.isArray`: see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray) for details about unsupported older browsers (e.g. <= IE8) and a simple polyfill.

### Performance (recent benchmarks results)

benchmarks ran on 3.4GHz Core i7 CPU width 16GB DDR4 RAM

```bash
yarn && yarn build && cd ./benchmark && yarn && yarn start
```
